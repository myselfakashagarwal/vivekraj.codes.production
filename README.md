# vivekraj.codes

[vivekraj.codes](https://vivekraj.codes) is an interactive Three.js website that aims to depict a professional portfolio. The website incorporates 3D elements rendered directly into the browser, and users can interact with these elements using APIs provided by THREE.js.

The website is deployed using GitHub Pages along with a custom domain.

# Dev & Prod
The project has two environments: [dev](https://github.com/myselfakashagarwal/vivekraj.codes.legacy/) and [production](https://github.com/myselfakashagarwal/vivekraj.codes.production/).

The dev environment contains the legacy codebase, where developers can write, test, and initiate the build. Due to its legacy nature, the commit history and continuous development might be complex, potentially containing additional elements that are not necessary for deployment. To address this, a production environment is used.

The production environment remains unaffected by the complexities and robustness of the dev environment. After successfully creating a build in the dev environment, the changes are pushed to production. This results in a clean codebase for deployment, avoiding unnecessary complexities and ensuring a streamlined production-ready codebase.
